Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql

You've now setup and are maintaining two databases for Bookmark Manager. Remember to update the README with instructions to create the test database, and run the psql commands for both databases.
